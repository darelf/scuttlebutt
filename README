ScuttleButt
===========
WORK IN PROGRESS - DOES NOT DO ALL THE THINGS YET

ScuttleButt library (See http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf)

This project depends on jansson for JSON processing: https://github.com/akheron/jansson


If you want to just build the library, after using configure go into the
`src/` directory and `make libscuttle.a`

Otherwise it wants to build the test program `scuttlebutt`, whose source
code is in `main.cpp`.

Compiling Notes
===============
Haven't done c++ in a while, so...  The Makefile.am specifies `-lrt` while that is
entirely unnecessary on my OSX Mavericks box. So, feel free to screw around the autotools
files to try and get it to "do the right thing".  I'm pretty horrible at autotools.

Oh, and you need both Jansson and libuv if you are wanting to compile the test program
that resides in `main.cpp`

I don't actually want this library to "stream the things", just return the things what
need to be streamed. In that vein, the eventual library built on top of this one that
implements the store will also use libuv to handle all the streaming...

( That libuv is pretty genius, btb. You should check it out at http://github.com/joyent/libuv )
