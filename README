ScuttleButt
===========
WORK IN PROGRESS

ScuttleButt library (See http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf)

This project depends on jansson for JSON processing: https://github.com/akheron/jansson


If you want to just build the library, after using configure go into the
`src/` directory and `make libscuttle.a`

Otherwise it wants to build the test program `scuttlebutt`, whose source
code is in `main.cpp`.
